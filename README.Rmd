## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to be an example of quantile regression for my colleague. It heavily lifts from the following two sources:

* Ford, Clay. "University of Virginia Library Research Data Services Sciences." *Getting Started with Quantile Regression*, University of Virginia Library, 20 Sept. 2015, data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-quantile-regression/.

* Brendan-R. "Brendan-r/quantile_regression." *Quantile Regression with R, JAGS and Stan*, GitHub, 15 Oct. 2015, github.com/brendan-r/quantile_regression.
